#1 KD tree always splits on full dataset , so there is no drop in data
#1 we drop data and pass only specifc data of the respective node

#2 we tried to put the data in such a way that the left node will not contain those data that are in the right node , but that failed , so instead when we are doing the analysis we are only passing the dataset that passing maximum diameter of the sphere in the rptree with a hope that indepence method can find something new for the rp nodek

#3 Completed adding decision circut for each node. Each node will through left or right data at each  processing of node

#4 tested code for SPN theory holding, that means each time spn was generated it wa stested if spn has a proper theory

$5 Currently Random projection stops at hieght is used as hyper parameter to determine the amount of height we need for an rp tree
